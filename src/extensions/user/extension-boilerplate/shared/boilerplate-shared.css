/**
 * An extension doesn't need to use shared files, but it is helpful to define a module here
 * and then extend it with the appropriate functionality in the other files. Optionally, you
 * could even define the whole thing in the shared folder, but fence off code specific to either
 * mode within if statements:
 *
 *   if (graceful.mode === 'desktop') {
 *     // Do things.
 *   }
 *
 * Try to split up code if it's appropriate for your extension. Doing so makes
 * everything more efficient by reducing the code to load and evaluate.
